USAGE:
To begin, run the command './mouse2'. From there, press 's' to begin drawing a (simple)
polygon. When you are satisifed, press 'e' to save it, or you may skip this step and go 
directly to pressing 'g' to place a guard. From there, watch as the program draws the area
of the polygon visible to the guard in red.

NOTES:
Complex polygons will cause an error. Supports clockwise or counterclockwise polygons. For
further questions, please reach out to Casey.
